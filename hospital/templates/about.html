<hr>
<p class="text-justify">The vision ‘affordable, accessible and quality healthcare for all’, a dream of visionary, Dr. K G Alexander was made a reality in 1987 with the commencement of Baby Memorial Hospital (BMH). The novel initiative then marked a revolution in the healthcare segment in Kerala, thus symbolizing an answer for the growing healthcare demands of the state. A tribute to late K C Varghese (known as ‘Baby’), father of Dr. K G Alexander, the Chairman and Managing Director, the hospital has set a benchmark in offering unprecedented care.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized health science and auxiliary healthcare staff and medical equipment.[2] The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received.Being committed to care for three decades has meant a lot to us. It helped us to understand better on how to give you more than care, through deeper understanding of your needs. We have thus, combined the best of healthcare, commitment and personal attention to give you a unique healing experience.</p>
